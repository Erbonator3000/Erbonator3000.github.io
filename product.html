          <h2>2018</h2>
          <p>In Junction 2018 our team won the data economics track and the sponsor challenge 
            "Frictionless payment" set by Poplatek. Our project was a coffee machine that could 
            identify the user based on their tagged mug and provide personalized service . The user 
            could register his or hers mug, billing information and drink preferences.
            When in need of a brewerage the user could just walk up to the machine, place their
            mug in and the drink would be served. selection of the drink and billing is handled automatically.

            <br>
            My part on this project was to design and build the physical prototype out of cardboard. 
            The internals consisted of a candy dispansing mechanism that could select between two variations
            of candy to demonstrate different preferences in the app (coffee and beer).
            The outer shell shape was designed to represent the overall brand of the product and match 
            the app design.
