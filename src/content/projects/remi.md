This project was a prime example of electronics rapid prototyping. As a friend of mine was developing a concept for
small wireless bracelet, that could notify the user through a mobile app, I saw the opportunity to build them a working prototype. 

The device consists of a Bluetooth module, batteries, and a vibration motor, all custom built into a 45x15x15mm enclosure.
The whole project was completed through one day prototyping sprint, including the firmware, electronics assembly,
enclosure design, printing, and testing. 

The device is capable of connecting to a phone with BLE and receiving commands to give a short vibration burst to
notify the user. Thus, the user does not need to keep his or hers phone in the pocket at all times, and can better
filter which notifications get through, removing unnecessary distractions.
