This color changing lure was the end product of a one-semester-long hands-on course 
on product development. Our solution was a Bluetooth-enabled fishing lure with 
over 50 RGB LEDs in three separate segments. In addition to the lure, we had 
a mobile application that enabled setting the lure color just the way fishermen
wished for.

The project brief and funding were provided by Rapala. Our team consisted of engineers,
developers, designers, and a business person, totaling up to 11 people with some of 
the members working remotely from New York and Warsaw. My task was to work as the 
project manager of this team, taking care of communication and making sure the end 
product would be uniform across the hardware, software, and the overall brand.

In addition to my management duties, I also participated in the electronics prototyping 
and design, and the embedded software inside the lure. The LED control and 
BLE communication were done with Nordic Semiconductor BLE module and was programmed to
work with the application.
