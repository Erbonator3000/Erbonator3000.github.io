Done as a 3D modelling and 3D printing exercise, this tent line tensioner became a typical example for rapid iteration on product development. As there were many aspects, like gripping ability, ease of use, and strength and durability, it required multiple quick iterations and adjustments to get it right. As a real product, while being compact and functional, it might be a bit over-engineered when compared to the typical mass-produced variants. 

The design is published under an open-source license, and the model is available [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3398911).
