In Junction 2018 our team won the data economics track and the sponsor challenge 
"Frictionless payment" set by Poplatek. Our project was a coffee machine that could 
identify the user based on their tagged mug and provide personalized service. The user 
could register his or her mug, billing information, and drink preferences.
When in need of a beverage, the user could just walk up to the machine, place their
mug in, and the drink would be served. Selection of the drink and billing are handled automatically.

My part in this project was to design and build the physical prototype out of cardboard. 
The internals consisted of a candy dispensing mechanism that could select between two variations
of candy to demonstrate different preferences in the app (coffee and beer).
The outer shell shape was designed to represent the overall brand of the product and match 
the app design.
