On the pilot run of Attract project course, one of the prototypes our multidisiplinary team developed was a weather aware IoT
controller. The device pulled weather proadcasts from ilmatieteenlaitos API and controlled relay outputs according to
configurations and rain forecasts.

This stands as a prime example of rapid prototyping in electronics. As a two person prototype team this device was created in a
couple of working days, including custom electronics, enclosure, embedded firmware and backend features.
