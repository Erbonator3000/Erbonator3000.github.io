After legalisation of nicotine pouch sales in Finland, the plastic waste from these cans exploded. As an electronics enthusiast, I designed a simple 3D printable battery holder to accommodate this trash into handy project boxes.

The design is a simple, fast-printing insert for the bottom compartment of the pouch can, which can hold two AA batteries. A small sensor board or similar can then be situated in the top compartment.
