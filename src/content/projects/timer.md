This project was about building an easily configurable timer to control a set of relays for automatic aquaponics system. The
hardware consists of STM32 microcontroller, OLED display with push buttons, and completely optically isolated driving circuit for
four relays.

The software running in the device allows for setting ten timer instances, that can be made to control any of the four relay
drivers. The user interface is built with simple menu system that user can navigate with up/down and select buttons. Through the
menu the user has access to set current time, set the timers, erase memory, or to inspect manual with pinouts and maximum
electrical ratings.
