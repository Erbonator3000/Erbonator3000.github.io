HeadCase is a mobile application which warns the user of possible 
concussions. The app pairs with Suunto Movesense motion sensor which is 
attached to the user's head. In the case of a powerful impact, the app fires 
a notification. The sensor could be worn, for example, by a kid doing sports 
and the app could be used by the parent. Alternatively, the sensor could be attached 
to a construction worker's helmet, and the app could automatically alert the 
first aid personnel in case of an accident.
