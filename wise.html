        <h1>Energy harvestin wireless illumination sensor</h1>

          <p>
            This electronics prototype was developed as a technology feasability exploration
            for Helvar. The goal of the prorotype was to test if indoor illumination energy 
            harvesting could be used to power a low-power wireless sensor. I also wrote my
            bachelor's thesis on the topic of exploring the suitability of indoor lighting
            for such sensors, available <a href="Indoor_energy_harvesting22122017.pdf">here</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            The communication and the sensor reading was done with Nordic Semiconductor BLE module.
            The energy harvesting was regulated with specialized energy management IC and 
            supecapacitor was used as a storage element. 
            <br>
            <br>
            My responsibilities included design and assembly of the prototype, and the embedded 
            software. Like stated earlier, I did my bachelor's thesis on related subject, so I had
            also measured and simulated the energy harvesting capabilities and power consumption
            to verify the devices function. The project included also a test device, built by another 
            student, that could log the voltage values during longer test periods.
