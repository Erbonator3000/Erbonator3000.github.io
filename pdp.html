        <h1>Product development Project: Color changing lure</h1>
        <div class="product-text">
          <h2>2018-2019</h2>
          <p>This color changing lure was the end product of one semester long hands on course 
            on product development. Our solution was a Bluetooth enabled fishing lure with 
            over 50 rgb LEDs in three separate segments. In addition to the lure we had 
            a mobile application which enabled setting the lure color just the way fishermen
            wished for. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The project brief and funding was provided by Rapala. Our team consisted of engineers,
            developers, designers, and business person totalling up to 11 people with some of 
            the members working remotely from New York and Warsaw. My task was to work as the 
            project manager of this team, taking care of communication and making sure the end 
            product will be uniform across the hardwareand, software, and the overall brand.
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition to my management duties, I was taking part on the electronics prototypin 
            and design, and the embedded software inside the lure. The LED control and 
            BLE communication was done with Nordic Semiconductor BLE module and was programmed to
            work with the application.
