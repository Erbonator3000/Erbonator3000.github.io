            <p>
            In Junction hackathon 2019 our team was tackling the winter time tiredness by building
            a smart lamp that makes light therapy easier to execute. The product is a portable, bluetooth 
            enabled daylight lamp with RGB color capability. The physical device is accompanied with an app,
            that reminds the user of the therapy and allows control of the lamp color.

            <br>
            In this project I was responsible for the hardware and embedded software. The electronics were
            built in a rapid manner mostly during the last evening of the hackathon with arduino, bluetooth
            module, and RGB LEDs. The shell of the lamp was made during the hackathon from a mix of silicone
            and cornstarch. The shape was achieved by fitting the silicone paste over a hand shaped mould piece.

            This project showcases the level of showcase prototype that can be achieved in such short time as one day. 
            When the purpos of the prototype is well defined (In this case demo functions ans support th branding)
            the building process can be streamlined and quik results can be achieved.
