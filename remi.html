          <p>
            This project was a prime example of electronics rapid prototyping. As a friend of mine was developing a concept for
            small wireless bracelet, that could notify the user trough mobile app, I saw opportunity to build them a working prototype. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The device consists of bluetooth module, batteries and a vibration motor, all custom built in to 45x15x15mm enclosure.
            The whole project was completed trough one day prototyping sprint, Including the firmware, electronics assembly,
            enclosure design and printing and testing. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The device is cabable of connecting to a phone with BLE and recieving commans to give a short vibration burst to
            notify the user. Thus, the user does not need to keep his or hers phone in the pocket at all times, and can better
            filter which notifications get trough removing unneccessary distractions.
